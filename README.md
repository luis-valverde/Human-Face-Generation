## Introduction

This repository contains all my work for the Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.

## Project Overview

Learn to understand Generative Adversarial Networks in this project and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN. This
DCGAN is made of a pair of multi-layer neural networks that compete against each other until one learns to generate
realistic images of faces.

In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Your goal is to get a generator network to
generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible.

## Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn (v0.17)](https://scikit-learn.org/0.17/install.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and
more included.

## Neccessary Files

This repository contains three files needed to solve the project.

## How to Run

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder on your machine where you've put the project files, and then
use the command:
